Adding storage to Linux systems is a very common everyday administration task - especially in virtualized environments.  While in many enterprise-grade systems this is done through Logical Volume Management (LVM), being able to add a simple disk to a physical or virtual server is still a common and critical skill.  This brief article demonstrates the procedure.

## Connect a New Disk

The setup of the Linux system will dictate how to connect a new disk.  If its a physical computer, actual hardware will need to be added (as in, open the case/rack and physically attach a new disk, not covered here!).  If its a virtual machine, the steps will vary by hypervisor, but are similar to the procedure below.  

In this example, Virtual Machine Manager will be used - this is a wrapper around KVM/QEMU hypervisor.  Other hypervisors include VMWare, Virtualbox, and Hyper-V.  

Adding a disk in Virtual Machine Manager is simple.  Navigate to the Virtual Machine information panel, and click "Add Hardware":

The size of the disk to add is entirely dependent on the space available - for this demo, we'll add a couple of 10GiB virtual disks:

![Add 10GiB Disk]({{< siteurl >}}/images/add10GiBDisk.png)

Once added, the disks will show up as hardware for the VM:

## Find the Added Disks with `lsblk`

Boot the system, login, become `root`, then use the `lsblk` command to find the device name of the disk(s).  Depending on the hypervisor being used, this could show up a variety of different ways such as `sdb` or `vdb`:

![New Disks within Linux]({{< siteurl >}}/images/newDisks_lsblk.png)

The new disks added are labelled `vdb` and `vdc`.  Within the file system, they can be found at `/dev/vdb` and `/dev/vdc` respectively:

> Note that this entire demo will be performed as `root` - it rarely makes sense for a normal user to manipulate storage.

## Use `fdisk` to Create a Partition Table

New disks usually don't have a partition table - meaning they are not useable yet.  There are two different kinds of partition tables - MBR and GPT (also known as GUID).  GPT is newer (and better!) and we'll use it for this demo.  

`fdisk` is the utility most Linux administrators use to manipulate disks, although there are other options such as `gdisk` and `parted`.  We'll use `fdisk` - issue `fdisk /dev/<diskName>` to open the new disk with the utility, then create a parition table with `g`, and write the changes with `w`:

![Create a Parition Table]({{< siteurl >}}/images/createPartitionTable.png)

> Help inside `fdisk` can be found with `m` (some think of it as `m` for Menu)

## Use `fdisk` to Create Partitions

Reopen `fdisk` for the `vdb` disk, and start creating partitions as needed.  For this demo, we'll create a 1GiB partition (but this is totally arbitrary!).  Use the `n` command to create a new partition on the disk, specifying the partition number, the starting sector, and the ending sector (or the requested size of partition):

![Create a GPT Parition]({{< siteurl >}}/images/createGPTPartition.png)

> Note that in "Step 4" above, pressing "Enter" will accept the default proposed by `fdisk` 

## Validate Partition and Write to Disk

Still inside `fdisk`, issue `p` to view the partitions as they have been created, making sure that the configuration is as required.  Once this is verified, issue `w` to write the changes to disk.

![Verify and Write to Disk]({{< siteurl >}}/images/printPartitionTable.png)

**!! Repeat these steps to create another partition on the disk that was created.**

Once both partitions are created, a simple `lsblk` should show both disks with partitions, ready for the next steps:

![Validate Creation with `lsblk`]({{< siteurl >}}/images/lsblk_newPartitions.png)

## Make a File System On the Created Partitions

Partitions are containers to hold file systems, which is the useable storage space for the end user.  Creating these just requires a `mkfs.<filesystem> <targetPartition>` command:

![Make File Systems on the New Partitions]({{< siteurl >}}/images/mkfs_disks.png)

> Just for fun, we created two different types of filesystems, one `xfs` and the other `ext4`.  Filesystem types are a big topic, but these are two very important types.

## Create a Directory for the File Systems

Unlike in some other operating systems, newly available storage doesn't show up as a new drive letter.  Rather, the new space will need to have a place assigned within the [Linux FileSystem Hierarchy]({{< ref "linuxFilesystemHierarchy.md" >}}).   Of course, these can be named virtually anything, in this case, we'll choose `/app` for the `xfs` storage, and `/db` for the `ext4` storage.  Simply create directories with the standard `mkdir` command:

```shell
sudo mkdir /app /db
```

As below (using `root`, therefore no `sudo`):

## Make a Backup of `/etc/fstab`

In order for mounts to persist through reboots, it is necessary to add them to `/etc/fstab/` - a critical file - that if incorrectly formatted can cause booting problems for a Linux system.  To safeguard against this and create a rollback plan, make a backup of the existing `/etc/fstab` configuration to ensure system recoverability.  Issue the command `cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab_bkup` (with `sudo` if needed):

![Backup `/etc/fstab`]({{< siteurl >}}/images/backupFstab.png)

This backup of `/etc/fstab` will be the rollback point if there is difficulty in booting the Linux system.  We're now ready to add each new disk to `/etc/fstab` and test to see if the mounts are working as expected.

## Make the Mounts Automatic and Permanent

Best practice for adding a device to `/etc/fstab` is to add the device by label or Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).  This could be gathered by copy/paste and mouse clicks, however, that option is not always available.  Here is how to add the UUID of a device to `/etc/fstab` without using a mouse:

``` shell
blkid | grep vdb1 | awk ' { print $2 } ' >> /etc/fstab
```

> Note that this APPENDS (`>>`) to `/etc/fstab`.  Do not overwrite `/etc/fstab`! (But if that happens, simply revert using the backup taken above!)

![Add UUID to `/etc/fstab` Without Copy/Paste]({{< siteurl >}}/images/addVdb1ToFstab.png)

> As above, it is ***highly recommended** to confirm the output of the command is as expected BEFORE appending it to `/etc/fstab`.  This kind of "trust but verify" mentality will save many blunders in the command-line.

Once the UUID is added, edit `/etc/fstab` and make sure the line is as follows:

``` shell
UUID="<yourUUID>"     /app    xfs     defaults        0 0
```

In our example, `/etc/fstab` now looks like this:

![First Disk Added to `/etc/fstab`]({{< siteurl >}}/images/appToFstab.png)

Repeat these steps to add the other mount point.  The finished `/etc/fstab` should look like this:

![Both New Disks Added to `/etc/fstab`]({{< siteurl >}}/images/bothToFstab.png)

## Mount the New Storage

After saving `/etc/fstab` with the above changes, the Linux system should now pick up the new mounts with a simple command:

``` shell
mount -a
```

## Validate Storage is Accessible

Verify both disks are showing up and that there are no issues with:
``` shell
mount | grep vd[bc] # will vary depending on setup/hypervisor
findmnt --verify
```

For example:

![Validate Mount Points]({{< siteurl >}}/images/validateMounts.png)

A couple other checks could be:

![Mounts are Useable]({{< siteurl >}}/images/mountsAreUseable.png)

And as a final check, reboot the system and make sure everything is still in place upon restart.  If the worst happens and the system won't boot, simply delete the modified `/etc/fstab` and replace it with backup version with (the system will drop you into a `root` shell to do this):

``` shell
cp /etc/fstab_bkup /etc/fstab
```

Go add some storage to a Linux system! Enjoy!

> As mentioned above, there is also a `parted` utility which works with storage disks.  Please check out the video below to view a similar demo using `parted`.

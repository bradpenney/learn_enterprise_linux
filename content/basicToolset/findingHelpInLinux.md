## The Manual Pages

The first and best place to begin looking for help within Linux is the `man` pages (short for manual).  For any command, simply type `man <command>` and a a manual page containing lots of useful information will appear!

Running this command:
``` bash
man lvcreate
```

Results in:
{{< figure src="/images/manLVCreate.png" caption="Results of `man lvcreate`">}}

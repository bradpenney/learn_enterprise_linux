In Enterprise Linux, editing text files is a critical skill for developers, system administrators, basically anyone who is using the command line.  There are a few options available:

1. Nano
   - A very beginner friendly editor to get basic tasks done quickly.
   - Lacks some of the power of other options.
   - Is generally frowned upon by the system administrator community - users are often seen as "newbies".
   - Installed by default on all Linux distributions.
   
2. Vi / Vim
   - The industry standard for file editing on a enterprise Linux system.
   - Most distributions have aliased `vi` to the `vim` program.
   - Some older versions of enterprise UNIX still use `vi`.
   - `vi` or `vim` is installed on all Linux distributions.
   
3. Emacs
   - Another useful tool, but much less commonly used in Enterprise Linux.
   - More useful for developers than system administrators.
   - Learning curve is steep for Emacs, but it does have excellent documentation.
   - Emacs is usually not installed by default on Enterprise-grade Linux systems.

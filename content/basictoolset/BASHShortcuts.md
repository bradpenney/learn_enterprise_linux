There are many keyboard shortcuts to learn in BASH (and Enterprise computing in general!).  These are the essentials:

| Command   | Result                                                                                    |
| --------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TAB       | Will complete a partially-typed commmand.  Options are listed if multiple available       |
| Up-Arrow  | Shows the previously issued command (repeatable)                                          |
| `Ctrl+e`  | Jumps to the end of the current command (line)                                            |
| `Ctrl+a`  | Jumps to the beginning of the current command (line)                                      |
| `Ctrl+c`  | Quits the current interactive process                                                     |
| `Ctrl+z`  | Pauses the currently running job                                                          |
| `fg`      | Restarts the paused job (this is a command, not a shortcut, but pairs well with `Ctrl+z`) |

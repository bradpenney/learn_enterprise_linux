Writing a "Hello World" program is a rite-of-passage in the programming world.  Here is how to do it in shell scripting (via the command line in an enterprise-grade Linux system).  

> Assumption: You already know how you use `vim`.

1. Starting from the command line, create a new file called "HelloWorld.sh" using `vim`:

``` shell 
vim HelloWorld.sh
```

2. Inside "HelloWorld.sh", write the following:

``` shell
#!/bin/bash 

echo "Hello World!"
```

3. Save the file and exit using `:wq`

4. Make the file executable by issuing the command `chmod 700 HelloWorld.sh` (see [Basic Permissions]({{< ref "/basicPermissions.md" >}}) for a more thorough explanation).

5. Run your file with `./HelloWorld.sh`:
